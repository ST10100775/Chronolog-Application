extensive data input when they are not in a highly productive mood, or feel it is a small
task but want to avoid burnout. 

These sessions will be an easy click-to-start and click-to-end with minimal data input, for
when users are not looking to do a task that needs heavy tracking and management.

just a click, minimizing the need for extensive data input. This simplicity is ideal for
users who want to quickly initiate a Pomodoro session without the overhead of
complex task management.

Running an Android Studio app downloaded from GitHub involves several steps. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you through the process:

1. **Install Android Studio:**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

2. **Clone or Download the Project:**
   - **Clone the repository:**
     - Open Git Bash or your preferred Git client.
     - Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL. For example:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
       ```
     - This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer.
   - **Download the repository as a ZIP file:**
     - Go to the GitHub page of the repository.
     - Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP."
     - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

3. **Open the Project in Android Studio:**
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Select "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen or go to `File > Open`.
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the project and select it.

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Android Studio will prompt you to install any missing SDK components or libraries. Follow the prompts to install them.
   - Open the `build.gradle` file and make sure all dependencies are up to date. You can sync the project with Gradle files by clicking the "Sync Now" button that appears at the top of the editor.

5. **Set Up an Emulator or Connect a Device:**
   - You can run the app on an emulator or a physical Android device.
   - **To set up an emulator:**
     - Go to `AVD Manager` (Android Virtual Device Manager) in Android Studio by clicking on the device icon in the toolbar.
     - Create a new virtual device by following the prompts.
   - **To use a physical device:**
     - Enable `Developer Options` and `USB Debugging` on your Android device.
     - Connect your device to your computer via USB.

6. **Build and Run the App:**
   - Click the green play button in the toolbar or select `Run > Run 'app'` from the menu.
   - Choose the target device (emulator or connected device).
   - Android Studio will build the project and install the app on the selected device.

7. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter any errors, check the `Logcat` tab in Android Studio for detailed error messages.
   - Common issues might include missing libraries, incorrect Gradle versions, or outdated dependencies. Address any issues as needed.

8. **Explore and Modify:**
   - Once the app is running, you can start exploring the code and making modifications as needed.
   - To make changes, edit the files in the `src` directory and rebuild the project by clicking the play button again.
